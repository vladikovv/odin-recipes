    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This doner kebab is so tasty — I'm sure once you try it, you'll want to make more! Serve with lightly toasted pitta or flatbread, chili sauce, and a salad of shredded cabbage, carrot, onion, and sliced cucumber. Also great to add as a topping for pizzas. It's easy to make in advance, slice and freeze for whenever you get that craving!
